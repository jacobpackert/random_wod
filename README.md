The "Random Crossfit Open WOD generator" project.<br><br>

This was a side project I made to learn more about Javascript, AJAX and using Google Sheets as a 'backend'.<br />
The workouts are all part of the 'Crossfit Games Open', and the scores are my own latest scores for each of the workouts.<br />
This way, I can go to my local gym, have this app give me a random workout (from the predefined set), and give me my own score to beat. <br />
Feel free to use it, if it makes sense to you. <br />
Or you could <a href="https://github.com/jacobpackert/random_wod" target="_blank">fork the code on Github</a> and type in your own scores.
